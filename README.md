## Who?

mindResin is the personal website of Paul Castle, a web developer in Aberdeen, Scotland. It's a project that is under constant development, and it's aim is to showcase Paul's portfolio and design/development competences.

## What?

This repo consists of the project files for the [mindResin website](http://mindres.in). mindResin was developed using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), a static site generator framework. Middleman is a great tool that allows you to compile static websites using SASS, Coffeescript and HAML/ERB/MarkDown/etc.

I primarily use Middleman to create boilerplates - the outputed static HTML/CSS/JS is used in web apps or templates for dynamic websites. 

Admittedly, this kind of goes against the static site purposes of Middleman, however I have grown accustomed to its [Live updating](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/livereload/) and Rails like features (without some of the unecessary overhead of using Rails).

The project files can be cloned and used in middleman immediately, however much of mindResin is built in PHP with a custom templating system, which I hope to make available at a later time.

## Why?

I've made the project files publicly available because like so many others, I learn best by example. Perhaps some of the techniques used here will be useful to you down the line. Maybe you are scratching your head wondering why the hell I did something the way I did? If that's the case, let me know how I could do it better! sharing is fun.
